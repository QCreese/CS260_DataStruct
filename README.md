Data Structures C++
1. List five topics related to computing that interest me.
   1. User security
   2. Error handeling
   3. Network mapping
   4. Storage systems
   5. AI
2. List five topics that are difficult right now or topics that I think are generally difficult topics related to computer or computing.
     1. User security: This can be an increadibly difficult task. A good program, website, or game should strive to keep its integrity by
        protecting its user's infromation. This can be difficult because people are constantly searching for easy ways to gather user information
        and sell their infromation. 
     2. Error handeling: Personally I am horrible with error handeling. My previous instructer game me some tips, but I am always working to improve this topic.
     3. Network mapping: How data is ran through a program can be confusing and having a functioning map of how items, variables, and other things is important
        for a good program. 
     4. Storage systems: I always tend to get lost when we are dicussing stacks vs. heaps. I feel like these topics are still a bit foggy for me.
     5. AI: AI is a new topic to computer science and I feel like there is a lot to be learned both from it and about it.
        AI can be an increadibly strong tool if it is used properly and for that reason I belive it is a difficult topic.
        Understanding how to use AI is going to be another skill set computer science majors should know.
